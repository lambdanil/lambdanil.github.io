Here I keep track of free software I recommend trying.

# Linux
## Distributions
* Debian - Still remains one of my favorites in the GNU+Linux world. Very stable, well organized and maintained. Well supported by 3rd parties and has good free software policies. Great for servers and desktops.
* openSUSE Tumbleweed or Aeon - Excellent rolling desktops, both very reliable. Excellent for workstations on more cutting-edge hardware.
* GNU Guix System - A very different system. Very fun to hack on but a little challenging for the average user. This one is mostly for the Lisp hackers!

## Package managers
* GNU Guix - Not to be confused with Guix System, it works as a package manager for any distribution. Quite user friendly and works great for getting extra software.

## Games
I don't play a lot of games but I enjoyed some of these. I haven't played them all yet!
* SuperTuxKart - a really fun kart racing game
* The Battle for Wesnoth - a solid strategy game
* OpenArena - old school arena shooter
* Xonotic - a more modern arena shooter
* DCSS, Brogue, Nethack, ToME - roguelike dungeon crawlers
* Teeworlds/DDNet - a multiplayer platformer
* Veloren - voxel MMORPG
